abstract = "The time average reward for a discrete-time controlled Markov process subject to a time-average cost constraint is maximized over the class of al causal policies. Each epoch, a reward depending on the state and action, is earned, and a similarly constituted cost is assessed; the time average of the former is maximized, subject to a hard limit on the time average of the latter. It is assumed that the state space is finite, and the action space compact metric. An accessibility hypothesis makes it possible to utilize a Lagrange multiplier formulation involving the dynamic programming equation, thus reducing the optimization problem to an unconstrained optimization parametrized by the multiplier. The parametrized dynamic programming equation possesses compactness and convergence properties that lead to the following: If the constraint can be satisfied by any causal policy, the supremum over time-average rewards respective to all causal policies is attained by either a simple or a mixed policy; the latter is equivalent to choosing independently at each epoch between two specified simple policies by the throw of a biased coin."

  abstract = 	 {For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016, Schulman et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting. We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety.}

Such problems can be naturally modeled as constrained partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs) when the environment is partially observable. In this work, we describe a technique based on approximate linear programming to optimize policies in CPOMDPs. The optimization is performed offline and produces a finite state controller with desirable performance guarantees.
